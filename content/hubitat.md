# Hubitat Server Application

The Hubitat application is the server for your LockShares, this is the only place where data about your locks and users is stored

you must install this before you can begin sharing locks.

## How to Install:

The recommended way to install the hubitat server application is via [Hubitat Package Manager](https://github.com/dcmeglio/hubitat-packagemanager)

Search for LockShare, and install all components, this will the allow you use the app from the `Add User App` popup in the Apps menu

once you have added the main LockShare app click `New LockShare User` to create a profile, one the profile is created you can navigate into it to detup for advanced options and get the unique share code to setup the app.



### I Don't Have Hubitat

I have been considering creating a version for smartthings, if that is something you are interested in, please tweet at me [@eliotstocker](https://twitter.com/eliotstocker)
