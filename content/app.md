# Android Application

For you or your users to access your Locks, you will need to install the android application from the Google Play Store

don't worry though, if you share a lock with a user that doest have the app installed already they will be taken to a page to explain how to install the app and get it all setup.

## What about other Platforms:

I have been considering creating an iOS app, but there are som financial constraints to consider, I'd also like to gauge interest, if youde like this please tweet at me [@eliotstocker](https://twitter.com/eliotstocker)
